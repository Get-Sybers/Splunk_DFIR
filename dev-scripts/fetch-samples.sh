#   Flags: --keep-archives retains the compressed source under .sources/ after
#          extraction (hash-re-verifiable, but doubles disk). The DEFAULT prunes
#          each source once its artifact is extracted, so nothing is stored
#          twice. Uncompressed artifacts (.E01, .dd, …) are never staged — they
#          download straight into the type directory.
#
# WHERE THINGS LAND: routed by FILE TYPE, then isolated in a per-group folder:
#
#     data_store/raw/disk_images/<group>/   the plaso lane
#     data_store/raw/memory/<group>/        the volatility lane
#     data_store/raw/pcaps/<group>/         the zeek lane
#     data_store/raw/other_raw_data/WinEvt/<group>/  the evtx lane
#     data_store/raw/other_raw_data/<group>/         no processor yet (mobile, apk, …)
#
#   Type is decided per file by its content/name (a single scenario group can
#   hold a disk image AND a pcap AND a memory dump, each routed separately). The
#   final <group>/ folder gives every download its own space, so files from
#   different corpora that share a basename cannot overwrite or silently
#   deduplicate one another — 172 basenames collide across the manifest, at
#   least one (terry-2009-12-11-001.E01) with genuinely different content. A
#   multi-segment set stays whole because all its parts share one group folder.
#
#   NOTE: the processing scripts currently glob their type directory at depth 1,
#   so they will need to descend into <group>/ subfolders (or be pointed at one)
#   to see these files — a deliberate follow-up, not an oversight.
#
# DECOMPRESSION and DEDUPLICATION:
#   Uncompressed artifacts (.E01 and its .E02…E0x continuation segments, .dd,
#   .vmdk, …) are downloaded straight into the type directory and verified in
#   place — there is only ever one copy. Every segment of a multi-volume EWF set
#   is its own manifest row and lands flat in the same directory, which is
#   exactly what libewf/plaso needs: the plaso lane processes
#   the .E01 and libewf pulls in the rest.
#
#   Compressed samples (.pcap.gz, .dmp.gz, *.mddramimage.zip) can't be consumed
#   as-is — zeek wants .pcap, volatility wants the raw dump — so they are staged
#   under data_store/raw/.sources/<group>/, verified, extracted into the type
#   directory, and then the staged source is DELETED so the data is not stored
#   twice (use --keep-archives to retain it). A .<name>.done marker records a
#   completed extraction so re-runs skip the work even after the source is gone.
#
# TWO LEVELS OF VERIFICATION, and the difference matters:
#
#   sha256 present  — pinned to a hash computed by streaming the object through
#                     sha256sum. A mismatch means the upstream object changed or
#                     the download was tampered with.
#   sha256 is "-"   — size-verified only. The manifest carries S3's own
#                     Content-Length, so a truncated or wrong-file download is
#                     still caught, but a same-size substitution is not.
#
# Everything fetched lands under data_store/raw/, which is deny-by-default
# gitignored. Nothing here is case evidence; the sources are public corpora.
# The small curated samples under samples/ are committed and need none of this.
