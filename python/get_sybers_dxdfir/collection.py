"""Evidence collections and the ``data_store/raw`` auto-sorter for the dxdfir CLI.

A *collection* is a named case folder under
``data_store/raw/collections/<name>/`` holding the same per-lane subdirs the
processing roles read from (``pcaps/``, ``logs/winevt/``, ``memory/``,
``disk_images/``, ``VM_files/``). A registered collection carries a
``.collection`` marker and a ``.collection.log`` — an append-only record of what
was created, registered, sorted, hashed and processed, so a case keeps its history.

Two ways in:

* ``dxdfir collection create`` + drop into ``data_store/raw/sort/`` +
  ``dxdfir collection sort`` — the tool files each item into the right lane
  subdir. Classification is **not** reinvented: it delegates to the processors'
  own magic-byte detectors (:func:`zeek.is_pcap`, :func:`plaso.detect_format` /
  :func:`plaso.ext_format`, :func:`volatility.is_memory_image`), so **content
  beats extension** — an E01 mislabelled ``.raw`` files as a disk image by its
  header, not its name.
* Stage the lane subdirs by hand. Such a folder is an *unregistered* collection
  (no marker); the CLI detects it and offers to register it so the run is logged
  (see :func:`unregistered` / :func:`register`).

Forensic-safe: a header-less file two lanes both claim by extension (``.raw`` is
a memory image AND a raw disk image) or that none recognise is never guessed — it
stays in the dropzone and is reported, for the operator to place by hand.
