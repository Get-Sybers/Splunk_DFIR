# Byakugan Phase-0 RISK GATE — the proof harness for the two load-bearing
# assumptions of the Elastic-native detection design (docs/riskgate.md):
#
#   1. a detection can be run ON DEMAND over an EVIDENCE-TIME window — dead-box
#      evidence whose @timestamps lie years in the past — with no silent drop,
#      re-stamp or age-out of old data;
#   2. ES|QL LOOKUP JOIN against the car-detections lookup index (the wave-1
#      contract under python/get_sybers_dfir/detect/rules/) flags logs-car.*
#      rows in place — the tagged-evidence-line model — on Elasticsearch 9.4.3.
#
# Stands up NOTHING: docker/elastic (the Byakugan stack: security on, TLS, Basic
# licence) must already be up. This wrapper only discovers how to reach it —
# the password from docker/elastic/.env and the CA from the stack's `certs`
# volume — and hands over to riskgate.py, which loads a small synthetic fixture
# into a `riskgate` namespace, runs the proofs and removes the fixture again.
#
#   ./tests/elastic-riskgate/riskgate.sh               # load, proof 1, proof 2, probe, clean
#   ./tests/elastic-riskgate/riskgate.sh --keep        # ... leave the fixture for inspection
#   ./tests/elastic-riskgate/riskgate.sh clean         # remove the fixture
#   ./tests/elastic-riskgate/riskgate.sh selftest      # offline consistency check (no cluster)
#   ./tests/elastic-riskgate/riskgate.sh load|proof1|proof2|probe
#
# Overrides (all optional): ES_URL (https://127.0.0.1:9200), ES_USER (elastic),
# ES_PASSWORD (else docker/elastic/.env), ES_CA (else fetched from the stack),
# RISKGATE_INSECURE=1 (skip TLS verification — last resort, loopback only).
#
# FAILS LOUDLY, never skips: a gate that no-ops when the stack is missing would
# be a green tick that proved nothing. Missing prerequisite -> non-zero + why.
