# 01_Containers

Every tool container the pipeline runs is **built in-repo, hardened** — nothing
third-party is pulled at runtime except the proprietary Kusto emulator. This
page lists the images, how they are built, and the posture they enforce.

---

## Build the hardened tool images

```sh
ansible-playbook ansible/collections/get_sybers.dfir/playbooks/dfir-build-images.yml
```

| Image | Tool | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `dfir/zeek` | PCAP → Zeek JSON | Zeek LTS from the project's OBS Debian repo (`docker/zeek/`) |
| `dfir/suricata` | signatures — Suricata (offline replay) | Debian package (`docker/suricata/`) |
| `dfir/yara` | signatures — YARA | Debian package (`docker/yara/`) |
| `dfir/volatility` | memory (Volatility 3) + `vadyarascan` | pinned PyPI (`docker/volatility/`) |
| `dfir/plaso` | Plaso timelining + `image_export` (dfVFS) | GIFT stable PPA (`docker/plaso/`) |
| `dfir/evtxecmd` | Windows Event Logs (EvtxECmd) | fetched EZ release, baked (`docker/evtxecmd/`) |

The `dfir_images` role builds each one and **verifies the minimal-posture
contract** per build — the static image config plus a shell-free
`docker export` scan proving the removed binaries (and, for the tool-only
images, the shell and python) are absent.

A start-time **inventory guard** then refuses to process against anything but a
known hardened image: each processor preflight asserts the image it will run is
a hardened `dfir/*` image, and `dxdfir verify-images` audits the whole `dfir/*`
namespace for missing, un-hardened, or **unexpected** images (something added
that shouldn't be).

## The hardening posture (minimal / attack-surface reduction)

Chosen for the strongest resistance to container escape AND to a
supply-chain-compromised tool: strip each image to the tool itself, and confine
every run hard. ansible does the hardening *at build time*
(`docker/hardening/harden.yml`) and is then **removed from the final image** —
it never ships at runtime.

- the tool is the image **ENTRYPOINT**; there is no ansible, no run-role, no
  orchestration layer in the runtime image
- the **uid-0 account is renamed `ansible`**, password-locked, nologin — no
  `root` login name exists; **sudo/su/pkexec** and the account-manipulation
  suite are removed; every setuid/setgid bit is stripped
- **no package manager, no pip** — nothing installable at runtime
- **no shell and no python** except where the tool irreducibly needs them:
  `dfir/yara` keeps `sh` (its per-file scan loop *is* a shell script);
  `dfir/volatility` and `dfir/plaso` keep python (the tools *are* python).
  `dfir/zeek`, `dfir/suricata`, `dfir/evtxecmd` carry neither.
- the tool runs as the fixed unprivileged user (`USER 2000:2000`)

Runtime confinement is what actually contains both threats (an attacker with
code execution does not need an on-image shell), applied on every `docker run`
the processors issue: `--cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges
--read-only --tmpfs /tmp --pids-limit 512 --network none`. Evidence is mounted
read-only, output read-write, the root filesystem is immutable. The single
network exception is Volatility ISF symbol fetch
(`dfir_volatility_symbols_online` / `--symbols-online`).

Why not keep a shell out of a "belt and braces" instinct? Removing the shell
does not stop an attacker who already has code execution (the premise of a
compromised tool) — they issue syscalls directly — and adding an in-container
orchestrator to police it only enlarges the supply-chain and execution surface.
So the design minimises what is present and confines what runs, rather than
policing a large image from inside.

## Pulled (unbuildable) images

```sh
mcr.microsoft.com/azuredataexplorer/kustainer-linux:latest   # analysis backend (Kusto emulator — proprietary)
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:9.0                         # evtxecmd operator-supplied mode only
```

The emulator cannot be built from source; `dfir_deploy_adx` confines it to
localhost instead (a non-local bind is refused unless
`dfir_deploy_adx_expose=true` is set deliberately).

## Offline / air-gapped hosts

Two levels:

**Images only** — `save-docker-images.sh` saves the built `dfir/*` images plus
the two pulled ones into `data_store/docker_images/`:

```bash
scripts/save-docker-images.sh --build     # online: build the dfir/* images, then save all
scripts/save-docker-images.sh --verify    # offline: load every tarball, then assert the hardened inventory
```

**Complete portable bundle** — `package-offline.sh` produces ONE artifact with
everything an air-gapped host needs — the images, the `dxdfir` CLI + all Python
deps as wheels, the pinned ansible collections, a clean archive of the repo, and
a `MANIFEST.sha256` over all of it:

```bash
# online host:
scripts/package-offline.sh --build            # -> dist/dxdfir-offline-<ver>-<arch>.tar.gz

# air-gapped host (no network needed):
tar -xzf dxdfir-offline-<ver>-<arch>.tar.gz
cd dxdfir-offline-<ver>-<arch> && ./setup-offline.sh
```

`setup-offline.sh` verifies every checksum before doing anything, loads the
images, installs the CLI from the bundled wheels (`pip --no-index`), installs
the collections offline, and finishes by running `dxdfir verify-images` so the
loaded inventory is confirmed to be the expected hardened set. Nothing reaches
the network.

The SOF-ELK stack (`docker/sof-elk/`, from-source build) is handled separately
by `dfir_deploy_sofelk`.

**Not containers:** **Hayabusa** ships as a self-contained Rust binary (no
official image) — operator-supplied: download the pinned release into
`data_store/dependencies/hayabusa/`. Disk-image file access uses host tools
(`ewf-tools`, `sleuthkit`, `ntfs-3g`) installed by `setup-environment.sh`.
