#   Version 9.4.1
#
# This is an example ipc_broker.conf. Use this file to configure the inter-process
# communication (IPC) related settings, such as specifying the TCP/IP network port for
# a helper process for splunkd. This lets the broker serve incoming requests and/or
# facilitate communications between helper processes.
#
# There is an ipc_broker.conf file in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/ directory.
# Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory.
# The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original
# location.
#
# To set custom configurations, create a new file with the name ipc_broker.conf in
# the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/ directory. Then add the specific settings
# that you want to customize to the local configuration file.
# You must restart the Splunk instance to enable configuration changes.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including file precedence) see the
# documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles
