Automates the processing of forensic evidence with
**[Plaso (log2timeline)](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso)**,
**[Zeek](https://zeek.org/)**, and
**[EvtxECmd](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/evtx)**,
and loads it into a local, offline
**[Azure Data Explorer Kusto emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto-emulator-overview)**
— the real Kusto query engine in a container, no Azure, no account, no cloud —
with field mappings aligned to the
**[MITRE CAR Data Model](https://car.mitre.org/data_model/)** exposed as KQL
functions.

## Disclaimer

Running DFIR tools in a containerized environment can be risky. Ensure you
understand the implications and risks before proceeding. This project is
intended for educational purposes only. Use at your own risk.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any of the tools used or
organizations mentioned.

## Overview
<a name="overview"></a>

Point it at a disk image or a PCAP, and it processes the evidence, loads the
output into a local Kusto emulator, and gives you KQL over normalised tables
instead of a pile of CSVs.

That's the idea. Here's where it honestly stands.

## How It Runs
<a name="how-it-runs"></a>

The pipeline is a three-layer design:

- **`dxdfir` CLI** — the front-end (`python/`, Typer): `dxdfir process <source>`,
  `dxdfir deploy`, `dxdfir ingest`, `dxdfir detect`, `dxdfir validate`,
  `dxdfir list` (`man dxdfir` for the manual).
- **`get_sybers.dfir` Ansible collection** — orchestration, one role per source,
  one action per task; the CLI drives it with `ansible-playbook`.
- **`get_sybers_dfir` Python package** — the per-item processing the roles invoke
  (also runnable as `python -m get_sybers_dfir.<source>`).

Each processor targets a backend with `--pipeline adx|sofelk`: **ADX** (the Kusto
emulator, default) or **SOF-ELK** (`docker/sof-elk/`). `dxdfir deploy`/`ingest`
cover the ADX pair; SOF-ELK deploy and delivery run from the collection's
`dfir-deploy-sofelk.yml` / `dfir-ingest-sofelk.yml` playbooks.

The `dxdfir` CLI and the collection are the supported front-end; the retired
per-source `process-*.sh` scripts have been removed (their behaviour lives in the
`get_sybers_dfir` processors). The signature lanes (`process-signatures.sh`) remain as
a shell layer. Install the CLI with
`pip install ./python` — it provides the `dxdfir` entry point plus its dependencies
(Typer and **ansible-core**, so `ansible-playbook` ships alongside it and the CLI
finds it automatically). `scripts/setup-environment.sh` does this for you — see
[Quick Start](#quick-start).

## Quick Start
<a name="quick-start"></a>

On a fresh Debian/Ubuntu host — installs Docker **and** the `dxdfir` CLI (with its
`ansible-playbook`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Get-Sybers/DX_DFIR.git
cd DX_DFIR
./scripts/setup-environment.sh      # Docker + the dxdfir CLI; log out/in once for the docker group
```

Then deploy the backend and run the pipeline:

```bash
dxdfir deploy                       # Kusto emulator + schema (localhost-only, no auth; accepts the MS EULA)
# drop evidence under data_store/raw/<type>/  (see data_store/README.md), then:
dxdfir process zeek                 # process one source: zeek | evtx | volatility | plaso | signatures | velociraptor
dxdfir ingest --only zeek           # load that source's output into the emulator
dxdfir detect                       # sweep detections across whatever is present -> misc.Detections
dxdfir --help                       # every command; `man dxdfir` for the manual
```

Query the results in KQL against the emulator at `127.0.0.1:8080` — the MITRE CAR
functions (`CarProcess()`, `CarFlow()`, …) and `DetectionsLatest()`.

Installing the CLI by hand instead of via the setup script (needs Python 3 + Docker):

```bash
pip install ./python                # provides dxdfir + ansible-core (ansible-playbook)
```

## What Actually Works
<a name="what-actually-works"></a>

This runs on the author's machine and has not been validated anywhere else.
Nothing here is production-ready, nothing exercises the pipeline automatically,
and interfaces may still change. What the current line buys you over the
[pre-release line](https://github.com/Get-Sybers/DX_DFIR/tree/deprecated) is
that the defects below are known and written down rather than waiting to be
discovered.

The **Notes** name the underlying tool; each source runs as `dxdfir process
<source>` (driving the matching `dfir_<source>` role → the `get_sybers_dfir`
processor). The ✅/⚠️ states reflect real runs on the author's corpus.

| Capability | State | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Disk images → Plaso timeline JSON | ✅ Works | the plaso lane (`dxdfir process plaso`); `log2timeline.py` → `.plaso` → `psort.py -o l2t_json_dfir` (our output module adds host/disk/volume ids). All image formats + VM exports → per-parser `host.L2t<Parser>` tables (routed by top-level Plaso parser; `L2tAll()` unions them) |
| VMware VM exports → Plaso | ✅ Works | Added recently, lightly tested |
| PCAP → Zeek JSON logs | ✅ Works | the zeek lane (`dxdfir process zeek`); `use_json=T`, ISO8601 timestamps |
| Zeek → Kusto (all log types) | ✅ Works | `conn` typed into `ZeekConn` by JSON path; every other log into the generic `Zeek` table |
| Raw EVTX → EvtxECmd JSON → CAR | ✅ Run on real logs | `dfir_evtx` role; bundled `dfir/evtxecmd` image (MIT, or operator-supplied). Validated on 103 real logs carved from the LoneWolf image — 55,638 rows into `host.EvtxEcmdJson`, feeding `CarUserSession`/`CarProcess`/`CarService` (real 4624/4688/7045) |
| Sysmon → EvtxECmd JSON → CAR | ✅ Mapping validated (fixtures) | Rides the EvtxECmd path; sources `driver`/`module`/`thread` and enriches `process`/`flow`/`registry`/`file`. Engine not run here (no Sysmon log in corpus) |
| Velociraptor offline collectors (EZ Tools) | ❌ Not provided | Collecting artefacts off endpoints is out of scope here — the repo processes collector output you supply (same Zimmerman parsers, no Kroll licence constraint) |
| Velociraptor processing | ⚠️ Partial | Normalisation script exists |
| **Kusto emulator deploy** | ✅ Runs | `deploy-kusto.sh` — localhost-only by default (the emulator has **no auth**), isolated network, real engine health check |
| **Schema + ingestion** | ✅ Runs | 5 databases; typed tables + ingestion mappings for Plaso json_line (per-parser `L2t*`), EvtxECmd JSON, Zeek JSON (conn + generic), Volatility, Velociraptor collector output |
| **MITRE CAR field mapping (KQL)** | ✅ **9/9 validated live** | CAR objects as KQL functions in the `mitre` database — `CarFlow()`, `CarProcess()`, `CarUserSession()`, `CarService()`, `CarFile()`, `CarRegistry()`, `CarDriver()`, `CarModule()`, `CarThread()`, plus `CarCoverage()`. **All 9 objects return real rows** on the live emulator. See [docs/Kusto-Port.md](/docs/Kusto-Port.md) |
| **Signature detection (YARA / Suricata / Hayabusa)** | ✅ Works | `process-signatures.sh`; **YARA** (files / mounted disk images / memory via Volatility `vadyarascan`), **Suricata** (pcaps → EVE), **Hayabusa** (EVTX → Sigma — validated 792 detections on LoneWolf). Emit JSONL to `processed/signatures/`; this output is not loaded into the backend |
| Chainsaw | ❌ Not started | Not built |

### Known limitations

- **No pipeline tests.** `./tests/run-checks.sh` runs the static and
  behavioural repo checks in CI (shell syntax, shellcheck, path resolution,
  the container-lifecycle library, Kusto schema consistency, evidence
  gitignore, secrets, doc links) — but nothing exercises the actual pipeline.
  Every "✅" above still means "worked when the author last ran it by hand."
- **Nothing has run against a real emulator.** The deploy, schema apply,
  ingestion and CAR functions are verified against fakes and fixtures only.
  The runtime checklist is
  [issue #14](https://github.com/Get-Sybers/DX_DFIR/issues/14).
- **Scripts `chmod -R 777` their working directories.** Convenient, not safe.
  Don't run this on a shared host.
- **Deploying accepts Microsoft's licence terms for you** via `ACCEPT_EULA=Y`,
  and the emulator is provided *as-is* and documented as "generally unsuitable
  for production workloads" — see
  [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
- **The `_time`/timestamp normalisation story is inconsistent** across
  sources. Plaso and Zeek are good; everything else is unverified.

## Before You Run Anything
<a name="before-you-run-anything"></a>

Three things that will bite you otherwise:

1. **The emulator has no security features at all.** No authentication, no
   access control, plaintext HTTP, no encryption at rest — documented
   properties, not misconfigurations. `deploy-kusto.sh` binds it to
   `127.0.0.1` and requires typing `expose` to bind anywhere else; that
   binding is the only control there is. It also runs isolated by default —
   no outbound network access. Not an airgap — see [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md).
2. **Deploying accepts Microsoft's Software License Terms on your behalf**
   (`ACCEPT_EULA=Y`), and Microsoft provides the emulator *as-is*, without
   support or warranties. Whether that fits your engagement is your call to
   make, not this project's.
3. **This handles real evidence.** `data_store/` is gitignored
   deny-by-default, so unknown and extensionless formats are covered. It is
   still a safety net, not a guarantee — check `git status` before you commit,
   every time.

## Why This Exists
<a name="why-this-exists"></a>

Most SOCs have already figured this problem out. Unfortunately, DeadBox
forensics still has its place, but it doesn't need to remain outdated. Learning
DFIR via DeadBox analysis is common and arguably a great starting point. DFIR
should be fast, efficient, and less tedious. This project automates messy
tasks, lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging faster DFIR skill
development by transforming forensic data into neatly mapped, standardized
tables you can query in KQL — offline, on your own machine.

## The Problem - DeadBox Forensics
<a name="the-problem---deadbox-forensics"></a>

DFIR analysts juggle mountains of fragmented artifacts and data produced by
various tools, leading to extensive manual parsing. This slows junior DFIR
analyst skill development and risks overlooking crucial details precisely when
speed and accuracy matter most.

## Get-Sybers Solution
<a name="get-sybers-solution"></a>

Automate and clarify the DeadBox DFIR data pipeline by normalizing data fields
consistent with the [MITRE CAR Data Model](https://car.mitre.org/data_model/),
queryable in [KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/) against a
local Data Explorer emulator.

*Aspiration, not current state — see [What Actually Works](#what-actually-works).*

## Benefits
<a name="benefits"></a>

- **Less Pain, More Gain**: Automate tedious tasks, focusing your time on investigations.
- **Accuracy & Speed**: Consistent mappings and automated parsing reduce errors and accelerate response.
- **Ready to Roll**: Quick-deployment scripts get you operational swiftly.
- **Offline by Design**: The real ADX query engine with no cloud, no account, and no network.

## Envisioned Endstate
<a name="envisioned-endstate"></a>

**This is the goal, not a working example.** The CAR functions that would make
this query return these results exist but are unverified.

```kusto
CarProcess()
| where isnotempty(command_line)
| project dtg = Timestamp, hostname, user, command_line, artifact = SourceType
```

| dtg                 | hostname       | user         | command_line                                              | artifact                 |

## Licence
<a name="licence"></a>

Apache-2.0 — see [LICENSE](/LICENSE).

Apache-2.0 was chosen by following the vendored code rather than by
preference. `car_data_model.json` comes from
[MITRE CAR](https://github.com/mitre-attack/car) (Apache-2.0), and earlier
releases vendored substantially more Apache-2.0 code (Splunk Security Content
lookups, splunk-ansible playbooks — since retired with the Splunk stack, but
still in git history). Matching that licence keeps the project compatible with
everything it has ever redistributed.

**Mixed licensing.** The repository root is Apache-2.0 (above). The pipeline code is
offered under the more permissive **MIT** licence as self-contained, reusable
components: the `get_sybers_dfir` Python package + `dxdfir` CLI
(`python/`, per its `pyproject.toml`) and the `get_sybers.dfir` Ansible collection
(`ansible/collections/`, per `galaxy.yml` and each role's `meta/main.yml`). MIT and
Apache-2.0 are compatible; each subtree carries its own declared licence.

Third-party components, the tools this pipeline drives, and the licensing
obligations that fall on *you* rather than on this code are documented in
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). Attribution required by
Apache-2.0 §4 is in [NOTICE](/NOTICE).

## Notes
<a name="notes"></a>

- Ensure your Docker environment is correctly set up before running scripts.
- The emulator holds your evidence with no authentication — keep it on
  `127.0.0.1` and treat the host as sensitive.
- Changes are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md).

🚀 **Happy hunting!**
