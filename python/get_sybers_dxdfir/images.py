"""Tool-image inventory guard — refuse to run against anything but the known,
hardened dxdfir/* images, and flag anything added to that namespace that should
not be there.

Two checks:

- ``require(image)`` — run at the START of every processor (its role preflight):
  the exact image the lane is about to run must exist, carry the
  ``com.get-sybers.hardened`` label, and run as uid 2000. A substituted or
  un-hardened dxdfir/* image stops the run before any evidence is touched.
- ``audit()`` — the full inventory: every expected hardened image must be
  present and compliant, and **no other ``dxdfir/*`` image may exist on the host**
  except the curated non-tool ones (the SOF-ELK stack, the molecule harness). An
  unexpected ``dxdfir/<x>`` image is something added that should not be — a
  supply-chain red flag — and the audit fails on it.

``docker image inspect`` is the trust anchor; the checks are pure over its JSON
so the logic is unit-testable without docker.
