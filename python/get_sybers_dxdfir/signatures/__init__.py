"""Signature/detection processors — YARA, Suricata, Hayabusa.

Port of the retired ``process-signatures.sh`` (+ its ``signatures/{yara,suricata,
hayabusa}.sh`` lanes and ``lib/disk-image.sh``). Runs the three signature engines
over the evidence and lands their native events as ingest-ready JSON Lines under
``<output_dir>/<lane>/``:

    yara       loose files + disk images (mounted read-only, needs /dev/fuse) +
               memory (Volatility windows.vadyarascan)
    suricata   captures (magic-first discovery, same as the zeek processor)
               -> Suricata EVE alerts (+context event types)
    hayabusa   Windows Event Logs -> Sigma detection timeline: loose .evtx AND
               disk images (staged image_export extraction, shared with the
               evtx processor — no fuse needed, extracted once, reused)

Each lane is a standalone runner (run one, or all via :func:`process`) — no lane
requires a processor to have run first, and a lane never re-does raw processing a
prior processor/detection run already staged. Container-first (YARA, Suricata) or
native binary (Hayabusa). Only the YARA disk source still needs ``/dev/fuse``
(mount-only by policy — it never extracts files out of images); when the host
can't mount it says so and moves on.

The heavy lifting (docker, mounting, the native binary) lives in the lane runners;
the parsing logic (yara text output, EVE filtering, detection tagging) is factored
into pure functions for unit testing.
