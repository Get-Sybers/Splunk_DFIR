"""Shared docker-run construction for the minimal hardened dfir/* tool images.

Posture (chosen for strongest resistance to container escape AND a
supply-chain-compromised tool): the images are stripped to the tool itself —
no runtime ansible, no package managers, no pip, no sudo/su, no setuid, uid 0
renamed and locked, tool runs as uid 2000, and NO shell/python beyond what the
tool irreducibly needs (yara's per-file scan loop needs sh; Volatility and
Plaso are python). The tool is the image's ENTRYPOINT.

Every invocation is confined at the runtime — which is what actually contains
both threats, since an attacker with code execution (the premise of a
compromised tool) does not need an on-image shell:

  --cap-drop ALL                 no capabilities (all pcap work is offline)
  --security-opt no-new-privileges
                                 execve can never regain privileges
  --read-only                    immutable root filesystem; the tool may write
                                 only to explicit mounts and tmpfs
  --tmpfs /tmp                   the one always-writable scratch area
  --pids-limit                   caps fork-bomb / parallel-exploit blast radius
  --network none                 no network by default — a compromised tool
                                 cannot exfiltrate or fetch a second stage.
                                 The single exception is Volatility ISF symbol
                                 fetch (``network=True``), an explicit opt-in.

The confinement flags stay pure list builders; run() additionally reads the
group owning each read-only (evidence) mount and --group-add's it, so a
locked-down evidence tree is readable by the image's non-root uid off defaults —
no per-run --user/--group knobs threaded through processing.
