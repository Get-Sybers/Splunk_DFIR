# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). While the major version
is `0`, anything may change without notice.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Detection-rule staging** so the `signatures` lane actually detects out of the
  box (the dependency dirs shipped with only a `.gitkeep`, so yara/suricata/hayabusa
  ran clean but found nothing). Every lane's `--fetch` now provisions its rule set
  into `data_store/dependencies/` — previously only YARA did: the yara lane's pinned
  DetectRaptor ruleset, **ET Open** for suricata (downloaded and merged into the one
  `suricata.rules` the lane loads with `-S`), and the **pinned Hayabusa release**
  (native binary + its bundled Sigma rules, sha256-verified) for hayabusa
  (`suricata.fetch` / `hayabusa.fetch`, mirroring `detectraptor`'s host-side
  pinned-download discipline — the hardened `dfir/suricata` image deliberately
  strips `suricata-update` and Hayabusa has no tool image, so neither can fetch
  inside a container). New `python -m get_sybers_dfir.signatures --fetch-only`
  provisions every lane's rules without running detection, driven by the new
  `scripts/stage-detection-rules.sh`, which `scripts/setup-environment.sh` now runs
  once so a freshly set-up host has rules staged. Downloaded rules stay gitignored.

### Removed
- **The Kusto/ADX layer.** The Azure Data Explorer emulator was the analysis
  backend from 0.2.0; the Elastic-native path (`docker/elastic`, the ES|QL/EQL
  detection rules-as-code, the CAR→ECS projection and its Phase-0 risk gate,
  the STIX/CTI exchange) supersedes it, so the whole stack is gone:
  `kusto/schema/` (databases, tables, ingestion mappings, the generated
  `mitre.car_*` tables and views), the `dfir_deploy_adx` / `dfir_ingest_adx` /
  `dfir_detect_adx` roles and playbooks, `get_sybers_dfir.deploy`, the
  `get_sybers_dfir.ingest` package (the Kusto REST client, the `.ingest` loader
  and its record shaping), the Kusto detection runner and registry
  (`get_sybers_dfir.detect` keeps only the Elastic rules-as-code loader), the
  `dxdfir deploy` / `ingest` / `detect` verbs, `docs/Kusto-Port.md`, the ADX
  check groups in `tests/run-checks.sh`, and the emulator's EULA/licensing
  notices. The `smoke` workflow no longer deploys an emulator.

### Changed
- `--pipeline adx` is now `--pipeline elastic` (the default): the processed
  tree the CAR lane builds from. The roles' `dfir_<role>_adx_out_dir` variables
  are now `dfir_<role>_elastic_out_dir` (same default paths); `sofelk` is
  unchanged.
- **`dxdfir verify-car`** reads the materialised CAR directly
  (`data_store/processed/car/<source>/car_<object>.jsonl`, or `--car-dir`)
  instead of querying the emulator — the same assertions (populated,
  value-sane, `car_action` in the engine model's vocabulary, traceable,
  relationship edges naming real endpoints) over the JSON that is the contract
  every sink reads.
- The **smoke test** asserts the Sysmon-derived CAR fields in the
  `car_<object>.jsonl` the engine writes and then runs the `verify-car` gate
  over the same tree; it needs no backend.
- `tests/run-checks.sh` (and the `checks` workflow) now run the Python unit
  tests when pytest is installed.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Materialized MITRE CAR: the engine ([PIIAT-MitreCar](https://github.com/Get-Sybers/PIIAT-MitreCar)) normalises each source to `car_<object>.jsonl`, ingested as the 13 `mitre.car_*` tables + `car_relationships`, with `Car()`/`CarObjects()` views.
- `dxdfir build-car` (build the per-source CAR stores) and `dxdfir car-timeline` (one property-rich, time-ordered timeline from car.db + superset.db).
- `dxdfir ingest --only car` loads the CAR stores into `mitre.car_*`.
- Zimmerman (EZ-Tools) lane: hardened `dfir/*` containers (RECmd, SRUM via Plaso, MFT, …) → CAR.

### Changed
- CAR extraction moved into the PIIAT-MitreCar engine (pinned submodule); memory/Volatility driven via the [PIIAT-Mem](https://github.com/Get-Sybers/PIIAT-Mem) CLI. `40-mitre.kql` is now the materialized tables, schema generated from the engine model.
- `dxdfir verify-car` rewritten against the `mitre.car_*` tables; `car_action` validated against the engine model's vocabulary.

### Removed
- The query-time `Car*()` / `Car<Object>_<Artefact>()` KQL functions — no backwards compatibility; read the `car_*` tables directly.
- The Velociraptor lane (role, playbook, ingest source, `host.VelociraptorJson`).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Plaso loose-artefact sources** (`--loose-dir` / `dfir_plaso_loose_dir`): one
  folder per host (/var/log copies, mobile filesystem dumps, triage output),
  parsed by log2timeline as directory sources — how the non-image OS families
  reach the timeline. Opt-in (loose trees can be very large).
- **Per-OS CAR validation**: `dxdfir verify-car` now asserts the Linux-facing
  sources with expected values (utmp login/logout + user round-trip, sshd
  logins with client port, cron command/exe round-trip) and reports an
  **OS-family coverage summary** (Windows events/disk/memory, Linux/Unix,
  macOS utmpx/fseventsd, network) so the release gate requires every family,
  not one standing in for all. Proven 66/0 over: Windows XP + Security/Sysmon,
  the 2020 Linux threat-analysis server logs (CentOS + Debian-style + pfSense;
  84k cron runs, real attacker logins), the macOS 2019 tuck image, an Android
  Nexus image, Volatility memory, and Zeek captures.
- **`dxdfir verify-car`** (`get_sybers_dfir.carcheck`) — the promotion gate for
  CAR correctness at the ADX level across EVERY lane, ported to Python from the
  original shell harness: asserts expected field VALUES (not just presence) per
  CAR source, round-trip fidelity (each normalized field == its native source
  field), per-artefact identity (every row carries a non-empty SourceFile —
  never data compiled together), roll-up no-fabrication (union == sum of
  sources), that no-producer sources (velociraptor: Srum/RECmd) stay empty, and
  the Plaso-extraction guards (process exe is a program never a parsed
  .pf/hive/$MFT; MFT names the file it describes; UsnJrnl deletes surface).
  Proven green (59/0) on a clean run over host Sysmon + Windows Security,
  network Zeek, memory Volatility (7 objects), and a Windows disk image
  (prefetch/amcache/MFT/UsnJrnl). Replaces the retired `tests/car-runthrough.sh`.

### Fixed
- **CAR-model logic (from a Fable audit against the pinned Volatility 2.28.0 /
  Plaso 20260720 field names)** — bugs a value run-through over Sysmon-dominated
  evidence could not surface: `CarProcess_Plaso` mapped exe/image_path to the
  parsed artefact's own path (a `.pf`/hive/`$MFT`) instead of the executed
  program (H1/H2); `CarFile_Plaso` labelled every MFT row `\$MFT` (H3) and every
  UsnJrnl row `modify`, hiding deletes (M3); `CarService_Evtx` read 7045's keys
  for 4697 (M1); `CarUserSession_Security` read the wrong keys for 4778/4779
  (M2); Sysmon-23 file hashes dropped (M5); svcscan `Binary (Registry)` skipped
  (M6); amcache sha1 / BAM sid mis-sourced (M4/M7); plus identity/representation
  fixes (SourceFile aliases, Velociraptor host/fqdn, packet_count null,
  vocabulary calls for 4625/4648/4779). Also added provider/Channel guards.
- The `dxdfir` CLI now declares the Python docker SDK (`requests`, `docker`) as
  dependencies — `dxdfir deploy`/`ingest` drive community.docker and failed on a
  clean install (and would have failed from the offline wheel bundle, which is
  built from these declared deps).


### Changed
- **Container posture reworked from the ansible-run-role model to a minimal /
  attack-surface-reduction model** — stronger against both container escape and
  a supply-chain-compromised tool. The runtime images no longer ship ansible or
  an in-container allow-list; each is stripped to the tool (tool-as-ENTRYPOINT),
  with no shell or python except where the tool needs them (yara keeps sh;
  volatility/plaso keep python). Build-time ansible hardening is kept (removed
  from the final image): uid 0 renamed `ansible` and locked, sudo/su and
  package managers/pip removed, setuid stripped, runs as uid 2000. Every
  processor `docker run` now adds `--read-only --tmpfs /tmp --pids-limit 512`
  on top of `--cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges --network none`.
  Images shrank substantially (yara 66→40MB, suricata 209→55MB, evtxecmd
  263→93MB).

### Added
- **Offline packaging** (`scripts/package-offline.sh` + `scripts/setup-offline.sh`):
  one portable `dxdfir-offline-<ver>-<arch>.tar.gz` carrying the hardened
  images, the CLI + deps as wheels, the pinned collections, the repo, and
  `data_store/dependencies/` (signature rulesets, Hayabusa binary, Volatility
  symbols, EvtxECmd) — set up on an air-gapped host with zero network:
  manifest-verified first, `dxdfir verify-images` proves the loaded inventory
  last. `save-docker-images.sh` now saves the built `dfir/*` images instead of
  pulling them, and gained `--build` / `--verify`.
- **Start-time image inventory guard** (`get_sybers_dfir.images` /
  `dxdfir verify-images`): each processor preflight refuses to run unless the
  tool image is a known hardened `dfir/*` image (label + uid 2000 + expected
  name); the audit flags any unexpected `dfir/*` image on the host — something
  added to the namespace that should not be there. The role verifies each build
  with a shell-free `docker export` scan.


## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Build-it-yourself hardened tool containers** (`docker/{yara,suricata,zeek,
  volatility,plaso,evtxecmd}`), Splunk-docker posture: ansible is the
  container's only execution path (pinned `ansible-playbook` ENTRYPOINT running
  the embedded allow-listed run role, `docker/runtime`); interpreters are
  pinned to baked wrappers; the uid-0 account is renamed `ansible` and locked;
  sudo/su and package managers removed; every setuid bit stripped; tools run as
  uid 2000. Hardening is applied by ansible inside every build
  (`docker/hardening/harden.yml`) and squashed.
- `dfir_images` role + `dfir-build-images.yml` playbook: builds every image and
  verifies the hardening contract statically and from inside the running
  container; molecule scenario proves a non-allow-listed argv is refused.
- Runtime breakout mitigations on every processor `docker run`
  (`get_sybers_dfir.container`): `--cap-drop ALL`,
  `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, `--network none`; Volatility ISF symbol
  fetch is an explicit opt-in (`--symbols-online` /
  `dfir_volatility_symbols_online`).
- Suricata per-pcap tuning template with the consolidated `SURICATA_VARS`
  registry; every stock suricata.yaml var auto-derived from each capture's own
  traffic and recorded for the operator.
- ansible-lint (production profile) gate; `requirements.yml` wired into
  setup-environment and enforced in CI; pipeline-agnostic `process.yml` per
  role with block/rescue diagnostics and check-mode support; molecule
  scenarios repaired and runnable via the containerised harness.

- The `dfir_deploy_adx` role now carries the retired shell deploy's remaining
  security properties: an isolated (masquerade-off, never `--internal`) docker
  network on by default (`dfir_deploy_adx_isolated`) with egress probed from
  inside the container after start, a read-back assertion that no port is bound
  to the wildcard address, and a preflight gate that refuses a non-local bind
  unless `dfir_deploy_adx_expose=true` is set as well (the Ansible equivalent
  of the shell's "type `expose`" prompt).
- The YARA lane's **disk** and **memory** sources are now in the Python processor
  (`get_sybers_dfir.signatures.yara`): disk images mounted read-only in place
  (ewfmount → ntfs-3g, FUSE; nothing extracted) → `disk.jsonl`, and process
  memory via Volatility 3 `windows.vadyarascan` (matches carry PID context) →
  `memory.jsonl`. `--yara-sources` selects sources; the mount/scan invocations
  are pure, unit-tested helpers.

### Changed
- Plaso is built from pinned PyPI with the libyal stack compiled from source
  (GIFT stable lags the `--output_fallback_hostname` the pipeline requires).
- No third-party tool image is pulled at runtime; the proprietary Kusto
  emulator (localhost-gated) and the stock .NET runtime (operator-supplied
  EvtxECmd mode) are the only remaining pulls.
- `data_store/.gitignore` prunes traversal (anchored skeleton whitelist);
  `git status` 25s → 0.014s.

### Removed
- The last data-pipeline shell scripts: `deploy-kusto.sh`,
  `apply-kusto-schema.sh`, `ingest-kusto.sh` and `scripts/lib/`
  (`docker-lifecycle.sh`, `kusto-api.sh`, `l2t-split.py`). The framework fully
  implements them — `dxdfir deploy` (the `dfir_deploy_adx` role +
  `get_sybers_dfir.deploy`) and `dxdfir ingest` (the `dfir_ingest_adx` role +
  `get_sybers_dfir.ingest`, whose `prepare.split_l2t` superseded `l2t-split.py`).
  The smoke test now deploys its throwaway emulator through `dxdfir deploy`,
  and the check harness asserts the localhost-bind, EULA-disclosure, isolation,
  ephemeral-default, readiness, endpoint-routing, Zeek-routing, l2t fan-out and
  staging-hygiene guarantees against the role and the Python modules instead of
  the deleted scripts. Not carried over: `KUSTO_REPLACE` (the role converges
  idempotently; remove the container for a fresh ephemeral instance) and
  `--purge`/`--purge-only` (ephemeral default — `docker rm -f kusto-emulator`
  is the purge).
- The retired per-source `process-*.sh` scripts (`process-zeek-ALL.sh`,
  `process-evtx-EvtxECmd.sh`, `process-volatility.sh`,
  `process-log2timeline-Dynamic.sh`, `process-velociraptor.sh`) and the dead
  `process-log2timeline-JSON_Line.sh` — their behaviour lives in the
  `get_sybers_dfir` processors (`dxdfir process <source>`). The deploy/apply/ingest
  scripts remain.
- The signature-lane shell scripts (`process-signatures.sh`,
  `scripts/signatures/{yara,suricata,hayabusa}.sh`, `scripts/signatures/lib/disk-image.sh`)
  — fully ported to `get_sybers_dfir.signatures` (the `dfir_signatures` role /
  `python -m get_sybers_dfir.signatures`). Not carried over: the shell lanes'
  online provisioning of the YARA-Forge starter, ET Open (`suricata-update`) and
  the Hayabusa binary — rules/binaries are operator-supplied (the Python
  `--fetch` provisions the pinned DetectRaptor YARA set).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- `dxdfir` CLI worked only where `ansible-playbook` happened to be on `PATH`.
  `ansible-core` is now a declared dependency of the package and the CLI resolves the
  `ansible-playbook` installed alongside it, so `dxdfir process`/`ingest`/`deploy`/`detect`
  work on a clean install.
- `scripts/setup-environment.sh` now installs the `dxdfir` CLI (into a dedicated venv),
  not just Docker and the userland tools.
- `dxdfir list` now inventories the evidence staged under `data_store/raw` (per source,
  with file counts and whether it is staged) instead of just naming the source types.
- `-h` is accepted everywhere as an alias for `--help` (`dxdfir -h`, `dxdfir process -h`,
  …), each level showing its own options.

### Added
- Root `README.md` **Quick Start**: clone -> `setup-environment.sh` -> `dxdfir deploy`
  -> `process` / `ingest` / `detect`.


## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- Hayabusa (Sigma detection) inside the evtx lane (`get_sybers_dfir.evtx --hayabusa`,
  `dfir_evtx_hayabusa`), scanning the same `.evtx` the lane collects — loose or
  disk-image-extracted.
- Disk-image EVTX extraction in the evtx lane (`--image-src`): WindowsEventLogs pulled
  from E01/raw/VMDK with log2timeline/plaso `image_export.py` (`get_sybers_dfir.imageexport`).
- Suricata tuning: `--home-net` / `--external-net` / `--suricata-set`, and
  `--auto-home-net` (HOME_NET derived per-pcap from the observed private subnets).
- DetectRaptor YARA provisioning (`get_sybers_dfir.signatures.detectraptor`): commit-pinned,
  sha256-verified fetch merged into the yara-rules ruleset.
- Pipeline smoke test (`tests/smoke-test.sh` + the `smoke` CI workflow): runs the real
  evtx -> EvtxECmd -> ingest pipeline over sha256-pinned Sysmon fixtures and asserts the
  CAR objects populate correctly.
- `docs/Signature-Rules.md`: adding your own YARA / Suricata rules (and tuning HOME_NET).
- **Detection orchestration** (`get_sybers_dfir.detect` + `dfir_detect_adx` role +
  `dxdfir detect`), modelled on DetectRaptor's StartHunts runner: a registry where
  each detection declares the processed data it targets (an ADX `db.Table` or a
  signature-lane JSONL output), a runner that surveys what is actually present and
  executes only the applicable detections (KQL detections run engine-side via
  `.set-or-append`; JSONL detections stream their lane files), and a unified
  `misc.Detections` output — every hit tagged with detection id, severity, ATT&CK
  techniques, source and a per-sweep `RunId` (`kusto/schema/50-detections.kql`,
  with `DetectionsLatest()`/`DetectionSummary()` views over the newest sweep).
  Seeded with 11 detections spanning EvtxECmd, Plaso prefetch, Zeek, Volatility,
  Velociraptor and the three signature lanes.

### Fixed
- `EvtxPayload()` parses EvtxECmd's JSON payload; it matched only the legacy XML shape
  before, silently emptying every Sysmon/Security-derived CAR field (command line, parent,
  service name/path, Sysmon network 5-tuple, driver/module/thread).
- `CarFlow` end_time preserves sub-second connection duration (was truncated to whole seconds).
- `ZeekSsl()` drops the always-null `Ja3` projection (base Zeek never emits it).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-21

### Changed
- Rebuilt the pipeline as three layers: the **`dxdfir` CLI** → the
  **`get_sybers.dfir` Ansible collection** (one role per source, one action per task)
  → the **`get_sybers_dfir` Python package**. Ten per-source roles/processors, each
  targeting ADX or SOF-ELK via `--pipeline adx|sofelk`. The legacy `process-*.sh`
  scripts remain as the legacy layer.
- Ran the Kusto backend end-to-end against the real `kustainer-linux` engine; all
  nine MITRE CAR objects return live rows (`CarCoverage()` 9/9).
- Made ADX ingest idempotent via an in-DB ledger, and tolerant of a processed file
  vanishing mid-read (concurrent processing).
- Collapsed the `ingest-kusto.sh` sources into a descriptor table and consolidated
  container lifecycle into `scripts/lib/docker-lifecycle.sh`.

### Added
- `dxdfir` CLI (Typer): `process` / `ingest` / `deploy` / `validate`, a man page, and
  80+ unit tests.
- From-source SOF-ELK image (`docker/sof-elk/`) and a bundled `dfir/evtxecmd` image
  (`docker/evtxecmd/`, DLL + `Maps/` baked in).
- Memory lane (Volatility 3) → `memory.VolatilityJson`, feeding the memory CAR
  objects (process/module/driver/service/thread/user_session/file/registry).
- Velociraptor loader → `host.VelociraptorJson`, re-sourcing `CarRegistry()`.
- Linux log processing with Plaso (syslog / auditd / utmp) and cross-platform
  `CarUserSession()` / `CarService()` / `CarProcess()`.
- Kusto schema: five databases, typed tables + ingestion mappings, and the MITRE CAR
  model as KQL functions pinned against MITRE's `car_data_model.json`.

### Fixed
- First live-emulator run: bracket-quote reserved database names (`network`),
  `0L` → `long(0)`, broadened the `CarFile` `modify` classifier, confirmed `tolong()`
  hex-pid conversion, and a dozen first-cut defects (query-vs-mgmt endpoint routing,
  per-host EvtxECmd staging collisions, empty-response handling, Zeek sentinel
  coercion, `ppid` source, header/`ignoreFirstRecord` handling).

### Removed
- The entire Splunk stack — deploy scripts, the eight Splunk apps, the in-container
  Ansible, and the ESCU lookups. The Kusto emulator is the analysis backend now.
- The KAPE automation (PowerShell, `KapeJson`); Velociraptor offline collectors
  (EZ Tools) take its place.
- Renamed the project `Splunk_DFIR` → `DX_DFIR`.

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2026-08-04

First versioned release, on the (since-retired) Splunk backend.

### Added
- Licensing: `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0), `NOTICE`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- The MITRE CAR data model + field mapping (Splunk `MITRE_CAR_App`), generated from
  the vendored `car_data_model.json`.
- Windows Event Log ingestion (`process-evtx-EvtxECmd.sh` + `EvtxECmd_App`), and this
  `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed
- `deploy-splunk.sh` gained `--purge` / `--persist`; redeploy became the default;
  first-party app versions demoted `1.0.0` → `0.2.0`.

### Security
- Network-isolated the Splunk container and closed an evidence-leak hole in
  `data_store/.gitignore`.

### Fixed
- Ten defects found by auditing the pre-versioned line — Splunk UI reachability,
  `--purge` safety, the `host` inputs-field literal, and the repository-root
  resolution across seven scripts, among others.

The pre-beta line is frozen on the
[`deprecated`](https://github.com/Get-Sybers/DX_DFIR/tree/deprecated) branch.
