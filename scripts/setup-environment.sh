# Prepare a host to run the DX_DFIR scripts.
#
# Installs Docker and the handful of userland tools the processing scripts
# shell out to, puts the invoking user in the docker group, and sets
# ownership/permissions on the repository.
#
# Pre-seeding the analysis images as offline tarballs is a separate concern
# with its own online/offline lifecycle — it now lives in
# scripts/save-docker-images.sh. The processing scripts pull their images on
# first use, so a host with registry access needs nothing further here.
#
# Each guard below encodes a way the previous revision of this script failed on
# a clean machine:
#
#   - `sudo` is NOT assumed to exist. The previous revision hardcoded it in 11
#     places and died on its first line ("sudo: command not found") on any
#     minimal container image, which is exactly where a fresh analyst
#     environment gets built. We are usually already root there, so the
#     escalation prefix is resolved once, up front, and may legitimately be
#     empty.
#   - Every prompt degrades to a default when stdin is not a TTY. `read` on a
#     closed stdin returns non-zero immediately, so the old prompts silently
#     took the "no" branch and the script reported success having installed
#     nothing. --yes makes that explicit and non-interactive runs assume it.
#   - The Docker apt repository is derived from /etc/os-release, not hardcoded
#     to Debian. The old URL installed a Debian repo on Ubuntu hosts, which
#     resolves but then fails to find the packages.
#   - apt-get runs with -y. Without it the install blocks on a confirmation
#     prompt that non-interactive runs can never answer.
#   - Permissions are u=rwX,g=rX (capital X), not 744. 744 clears the execute
#     bit on DIRECTORIES for the group, so members of the docker group the
#     script had just created could not traverse into the very repository it
#     had just given them. Capital X applies +x to directories and to files
#     that are already executable, leaving the .sh files runnable and data
#     files alone.
#   - unzip is installed, not merely hoped for. the velociraptor lane hard
#     exits without it and the old script never mentioned it.
#
# Usage: scripts/setup-environment.sh [--yes] [--help]
