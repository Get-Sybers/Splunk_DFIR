# Set the project version in the few places that genuinely carry it.

#   ./dev-scripts/set-version.sh 0.3.0-alpha.1
#
# Why this exists: promoting alpha -> beta once meant hand-editing a dozen
# documents, and a stale string in any of them would have made the release
# contradict itself. Maturity now lives in the git tag and the GitHub Release,
# surfaced by a badge that reads them directly — so prose never needs touching.
#
# What still carries a literal version, and why:
#   CHANGELOG.md    the versioned record; that is its whole job
#
# Everything else reads the release from the badge or the CHANGELOG.
#
# This does NOT tag. Releasing is:
#   ./dev-scripts/set-version.sh X.Y.Z-pre.N
#   git commit -am "Release vX.Y.Z-pre.N"
#   git tag -a vX.Y.Z-pre.N -m "vX.Y.Z-pre.N"
#   git push origin main --follow-tags
# then create the GitHub Release from the tag, ticking "pre-release" for any
# -alpha / -beta / -rc.
